<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project served as a valuable learning experience as a hands-on way to practice Python programming concepts such as:

- **Language Fundamentals:** Strengthened foundational knowledge in Python, including variables, control structures, and functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Applied object-oriented principles to design and implement a modular fighter class.
- **Python Libraries:** Gained hands-on experience with Pygame, a popular library for creating 2D games.
- **Class Design:** Developed a modular and extensible codebase, with a Fighter class that encapsulates fighter attributes and behavior.
- **Code Organization:** Structured the project with a clear separation of concerns, including distinct files for the main game loop, fighter class, and assets.

#### Game Development

- **State Management:** Explored techniques for managing different states in a game, such as gameplay, victory screens, and round transitions.
- **Collision Detection:** Implemented collision detection to determine when fighters attack each other or take damage.
- **Player Controls:** Implemented responsive controls for player movement, jumping, and attacking using the Pygame library.
- **Animation System:** Developed an animation system to smoothly transition between different character animations such as idle, running, jumping, attacking, and more.
